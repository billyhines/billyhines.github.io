title: About me
---

My name is Billy Hines. I am a data scientist based in Boston, MA. I currently work at Randstad, where I have been focusing on recommendation systems and optimizing search relevance algorithms.  

As a key member of small, agile teams, I thrive in end-to-end development environments. My expertise spans the entire data science pipeline â€“ from data collection and preprocessing to model development, deployment, and maintenance. This comprehensive approach allows me to deliver holistic solutions that drive real business value.
